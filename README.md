### 🌳

I am currently working as a Tech Lead in the iOS team! 🍎👋 In the recent past I was working as an Enginering Manager. I missed coding, so I am again in the individual contributor track! 😄🛠

If I can help you with anything, from iOS, career advise or farming let me know! 👨‍🌾🥕 

### Colaboration 👯‍♀️

I am always up to colaborate on exciting OSS projects. So if you need a hand, don't hesitate. 🚀 Ideally this project is a consumer facing product, not necessarily a tool for other developers. 🙄

### Focus for 2020 👀

- ... less running and more cycling 🚴‍♀️
- ... read more and spend less time on social networks 📚
- ... be grateful for what I have 👨‍👩‍👦
