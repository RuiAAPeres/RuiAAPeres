I am currently working as an iOS dev @ Sphere! 🍎👋 In the recent past I was working as an Enginering Manager. I missed coding, so I am again in the individual contributor track! 😄🛠

If I can help you with anything, from iOS, career advise or farming let me know! 👨‍🌾🥕 

#### Collaboration 👯‍♀️

I am always up to collaborate on exciting OSS projects. So if you need a hand, don't hesitate. 🚀 Ideally this project is a consumer facing product, not necessarily a tool for other developers. 🙄
